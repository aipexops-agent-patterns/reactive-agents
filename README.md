### Characteristics of the Code:

### Sense-Think-Act Loop:
The agent operates in a loop (while turn_count < max_turns:), continuously sensing input (through messages), reasoning (generating a response using generate_text_with_conversation), and acting based on the extracted function (action_function(arguments)).

### Rule-Based Decisions:
The available actions (available_actions) and the function name checks indicate that the agent decides its actions based on predefined rules (a hallmark of reactive systems).

### Stateless Nature:
The system does not appear to maintain complex internal states about past interactions; it operates based on the current input (messages) and the available responses. This is another trait of reactive agents.

### Focus on Immediate Goals:
The agent's task is to process the user's input, extract the relevant action, and invoke the corresponding function immediately without long-term planning.

### Design Pattern:
Reactive Agents: These agents respond directly to the environment and operate based on stimuli without extensive planning or complex reasoning about future states.
They rely on a sense-act paradigm where actions are triggered by the perceived state of the environment.
